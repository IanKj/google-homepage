This is the first project from the Odin Project. I started it on my windows desktop and am in the process of moving it all to a Linux environment and git. 

So far I've created the basic set up but I need to work a lot on the spacings. Once I have the spacings down I need to work on the fonts and make it look polished. I don't think it will take too much longer, I've done most of the work.

I would like to come back to this project and try it again eventually. My CSS is a mess and I know I could do better. Maybe I'll comb through the CSS before I move on and see if I can clean it up some.
